# BASH Scripts

This is my personal repo of BASH scripts I am writing for my own personal use. If you find them useful--great. If you want to improve them, go for it. I am learning, so you will probably find plenty of stuff that could be done better.

## downloaded_file_cleanup.sh
⚠️ __Important: This script must be ran in the "parent" directory where the child folders are contained (which themselves hold the file(s).__


This script is good for cleaning up files that may have been downloaded into a subfolder. It will pull the files out of the subfolders and move them into the parent directory. It can then delete the child folders from which the files were removed. Sometimes the folders are not empty, so it does so forcibly. The script has a menu system and does things in steps with prompts. It is descrucitve if completed out of order, so use with caution and at your own risk!
